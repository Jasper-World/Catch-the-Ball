# Catch-the-Ball
a game that run by EV3 and simplies from russian cube
When I was small there’s a game called Russian cube today I simplifies the game and use legoEV3 to rebuild it I called my new game catch the ball and I make it can record the score every ball is 10 score if you didn’t catch it will stop the program.
# How it Work
1.	When you run the program there is a ball randomly to appear on the top of the screen and slowly drop down
2.	At the down of the screen it will be a small wood black that was ten pixel you can contral the black to go right or left by pressing the sensor and you can make a handle

3.	every you use the block to catch the ball the ball will drop faster
